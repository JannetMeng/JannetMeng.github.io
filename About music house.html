				About my "music house"

				I have a "music talent" since I was a child, which comes from my family.

				My grandfather is a big fan of music. When he has free time, he often stand in the yard and sings loudly. The voice is very beautiful. My grandmother also loves music very much, she likes listening to music. My dad likes singing. He is very affectionate when he sings, and he is devoted to music. His magnetic voice makes the songs more touching. My mother sings very well. She loves songs, old songs and folk songs.

			<p class="serif">
				I love music very much. I learned violin from an early age.  I studied music composition when I was undergraduate. So I like composing music. Especially classic music.  I hope here is my another "Music House", and I wanna say :welcome to everyone who likes music to communicate with me.			</p>
